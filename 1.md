## How to use laravel default authentication in backpack

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083652/how-to-use-laravel-default-authentication-in-backpack

You can disable all of Backpack's auth routes in `config/backpack/base.php`
```
'setup_auth_routes' => false,
```

And make Backpack use the default guard everywhere by setting this to null in the same file:
```
'guard' => null,
```

Now you need to change `app/Http/Middleware/CheckIfAdmin.php` as per your needs.


## Change Records Per Page

Open `config/backpack/crud.php`

Edit line `'pageLengthMenu'` and edit as per your need

## Change Project name

Open `config/backpack/base.php`

```
'project_name' => 'Ghanshyam'
```

```
'project_logo' => '<b>Ghanshyam</b>'
```

## Include table in BackPack Admin

Bash Command
```
php artisan backpack:crud user
```
